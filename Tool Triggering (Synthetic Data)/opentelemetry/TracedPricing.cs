    /// package references -- the always-compiled path keeps the fixture analysable
    /// on all thirteen families. Second, tracing is NOT path coverage: the tool list
    /// assigns OpenTelemetry to one Path Coverage row, and a span count can never
    /// answer that metric. This folder makes the span real so the mis-assignment is
    /// demonstrable rather than asserted.

    /// The TypeScript corpus shipped an OTel bootstrap that registered a no-op
    /// processor, exported nothing and exited 0. The counter below exists so a zero
    /// here cannot be mistaken for a clean run.</summary>
