# OrderKit - CS_VNET8_DOTNETCLI_NUGETPACKAGEREFERENCE_MONO

One branch of the C# tool-evaluation corpus. Test **data**, not a product: tool
execution is not part of the build, and evaluation happens later.

## Branch

`CS_VNET8_DOTNETCLI_NUGETPACKAGEREFERENCE_MONO`

## Cell

| Axis | Value |
|---|---|
| Bundler | .NET CLI |
| Package manager | NuGet (PackageReference) |
| Architecture | Monolith |

Projects:

- `OrderKit` (`src/OrderKit`)

## Target framework

`net8.0` - .NET 8

The first family in this corpus that is STILL IN SUPPORT (LTS, to 10 November 2026), and the first whose target framework MATCHES the pinned SDK -- every earlier family was built by an SDK newer than its own target. packages.config remains dead, so six of the 24 cells stay impossible.

## Language version

C# 12.0, taken as the default of the target framework. `LangVersion` is deliberately
never written to any project file, which is what keeps the family axis one number
instead of two.

The domain layer is written to that language subset exactly, and the lock is
verified by execution rather than asserted:

```
csc -langversion:12.0   ->  clean
csc -langversion:11.0   ->  error CS8025: Feature 'async function' is not available
```

## Supported tools

6 of the 19 tools in the roster are expected to fire on this branch. The rest exit
3 (cannot run here) or 4 (absent from this host), each with its reason in both
`run.sh` and `trigger.yaml`.

**A tool that does not fire is a result, not a failure.** What a family with *no*
firing tools cannot do is distinguish "correctly detected nothing" from "the scan
never ran" - so the source-level tools below are the built-in negative control:

- Lizard
- jscpd
- Semgrep
- PyDriller
- git log --numstat

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

Restore will not succeed on a host where NuGet is unreachable; see `dataset.json`
`blockedHosts`.

## Test

```bash
./build.sh          # the test step is wired into the build
```

19 tests are declared. They are **not** executed in this corpus's build, because no
test framework can be restored.

## Tool triggering data

The tool folder is `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)` (renamed from `tools`). Every one of its 19 folders
carries data that could trigger its tool, whether or not the tool can run on
this family -- the product ships the tools and does the running, so the data
has to be present either way. Each folder's `DATA.md` says what is planted in
it and what a correct run should measure.

No folder contains a project manifest. One there would make the platform treat
the folder as a project of its own and run the whole roster against it.

## Tool entry points

```bash
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py"            # banner
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --verify   # every runner present and executable
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --run      # run them all, compare to dataset.json
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/full_check.py"                  # cross-file consistency audit
```

## What is expected to fire

`dataset.json` asserts the answer rather than describing it, so a platform that
reports nothing for a given tool can be *proven* correct instead of assumed correct.
Every runner's expected exit code is recorded there, and
`tool_integration.py --run` exits **2** if any tool produces a result the dataset
does not already record - a new finding, as distinct from a measurement.
