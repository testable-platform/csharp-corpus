# OrderKit - CS_VNETFX47_SDKMSBUILD_CPM_MONO

One branch of the C# tool-evaluation corpus. Test **data**, not a product: tool
execution is not part of the build, and evaluation happens later.

## Branch

`CS_VNETFX47_SDKMSBUILD_CPM_MONO`

## Cell

| Axis | Value |
|---|---|
| Bundler | SDK-style MSBuild |
| Package manager | Central Package Management |
| Architecture | Monolith |

Projects:

- `OrderKit` (`src/OrderKit`)

## Target framework

`net47` - .NET Framework 4.7

In support until 12 January 2027, and above the netstandard2.0 boundary, so Coverlet and OpenTelemetry are held out by NuGet alone (exit 4) rather than by the target framework (exit 3). This is also the first target framework to ship System.ValueTuple IN-BOX, which is why tuples appear in the domain here and were declined one family below -- see domain71.py.

## Language version

C# 7.1, taken as the default of the target framework. `LangVersion` is deliberately
never written to any project file, which is what keeps the family axis one number
instead of two.

The domain layer is written to that language subset exactly, and the lock is
verified by execution rather than asserted:

```
csc -langversion:7.1   ->  clean
csc -langversion:7.0   ->  error CS8025: Feature 'async function' is not available
```

## Supported tools

6 of the 19 tools in the roster are expected to fire on this branch. The rest exit
3 (cannot run here) or 4 (absent from this host), each with its reason in both
`run.sh` and `trigger.yaml`.

**A tool that does not fire is a result, not a failure.** What a family with *no*
firing tools cannot do is distinguish "correctly detected nothing" from "the scan
never ran" - so the source-level tools below are the built-in negative control:

- Lizard
- jscpd
- Semgrep
- PyDriller
- git log --numstat

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

Restore will not succeed on a host where NuGet is unreachable; see `dataset.json`
`blockedHosts`.

## Test

```bash
./build.sh          # the test step is wired into the build
```

19 tests are declared. They are **not** executed in this corpus's build, because no
test framework can be restored.

## Tool data folders

Four folders carry the per-tool data, the same four every language corpus in
this programme uses. Their contents are byte-identical on every branch of this
repository.

| Folder | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)` | 19 folders of planted data, one per runner, written to trigger its tool at this family's language version. Each folder's `DATA.md` says what is planted and what a correct run should measure. |
| `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)` | The 17 roster tools, with code a tool should find **nothing** in. The false-positive control. |
| `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)` | The same 17 tools, with code a tool **should** flag. The true-positive control. |
| `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)` | Each tool's own upstream test suite, copied byte-for-byte from the tool's repository. `SOURCE.md` records the repo, commit and licence. |

Clean and Invalid carry five version folders per tool -- `netfx45`, `netfx46`,
`netcoreapp30`, `net9`, `net10`. Each compiles at its own C# level, and its
`LanguageMarker` is rejected one level below, so the version a folder claims is
verified by execution rather than asserted.

**Clean, Invalid and Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data) contain no project
manifest** -- no `.csproj`, `.sln`, `packages.config` or lockfile. One there
would make the platform treat the folder as a project of its own and run the
whole roster against it. `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)` is the
deliberate exception: it is upstream code kept exactly as upstream ships it,
manifests included.

## Tool entry points

```bash
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py"            # banner
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --verify   # every runner present and executable
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/tool_integration.py" --run      # run them all, compare to dataset.json
python3 "Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/full_check.py"                  # cross-file consistency audit
```

## What is expected to fire

`dataset.json` asserts the answer rather than describing it, so a platform that
reports nothing for a given tool can be *proven* correct instead of assumed correct.
Every runner's expected exit code is recorded there, and
`tool_integration.py --run` exits **2** if any tool produces a result the dataset
does not already record - a new finding, as distinct from a measurement.
