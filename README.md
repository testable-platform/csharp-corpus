# OrderKit - CS-115

One branch of the C# tool-evaluation corpus. Test **data**, not a product: tool
execution is not part of the build, and evaluation happens later.

## Branch

`CS-115`

## Cell

| Axis | Value |
|---|---|
| Bundler | .NET CLI |
| Package manager | Paket |
| Architecture | Monolith |

Projects:

- `OrderKit` (`src/OrderKit`)

## Target framework

`net471` - .NET Framework 4.7.1

In support until 12 January 2027, and above the netstandard2.0 boundary, so Coverlet and OpenTelemetry are held out by NuGet alone (exit 4) rather than by the target framework (exit 3). This is also the first target framework where every language lock in the domain is compiler-only, so none of them depends on a package this host cannot restore -- unlike the ValueTuple question one family below. See domain72.py.

## Language version

C# 7.2, taken as the default of the target framework. `LangVersion` is deliberately
never written to any project file, which is what keeps the family axis one number
instead of two.

The domain layer is written to that language subset exactly, and the lock is
verified by execution rather than asserted:

```
csc -langversion:7.2   ->  clean
csc -langversion:7.1   ->  error CS8025: Feature 'async function' is not available
```

## Supported tools

5 of the 19 tools in the roster are expected to fire on this branch. The rest exit
3 (cannot run here) or 4 (absent from this host), each with its reason in both
`run.sh` and `trigger.yaml`.

**A tool that does not fire is a result, not a failure.** What a family with *no*
firing tools cannot do is distinguish "correctly detected nothing" from "the scan
never ran" - so the source-level tools below are the built-in negative control:

- Lizard
- jscpd
- Semgrep
- PyDriller
- git log --numstat

| Tool | Status | Why |

| Lizard | active | Python tokeniser. Class B: own parser, never loads a compiler, so the TFM is irrelevant  |

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

Restore will not succeed on a host where NuGet is unreachable; see `dataset.json`
`blockedHosts`.

## Test

```bash
./build.sh          # the test step is wired into the build
```

19 tests are declared. They are **not** executed in this corpus's build, because no
test framework can be restored.

## Tool entry points

```bash
python3 tools/tool_integration.py            # banner
python3 tools/tool_integration.py --verify   # every runner present and executable
python3 tools/tool_integration.py --run      # run them all, compare to dataset.json
python3 tools/full_check.py                  # cross-file consistency audit
```

## What is expected to fire

`dataset.json` asserts the answer rather than describing it, so a platform that
reports nothing for a given tool can be *proven* correct instead of assumed correct.
Every runner's expected exit code is recorded there, and
`tool_integration.py --run` exits **2** if any tool produces a result the dataset
does not already record - a new finding, as distinct from a measurement.
